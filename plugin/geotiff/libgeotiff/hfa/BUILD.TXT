	Building img2tif
	================


Windows (NT/2000/98/etc)
------------------------

Ensure that VC++ is installed properly.  The appropriate path and environment
variables will need to be setup if they aren't already.  This can usualy
be done by running C:\Program Files\Visual Stdio\VC98\VCVARS32.BAT or
something similar in the command window. 

Then just run buildwin.bat to build img2tif.exe and hfatest.exe



Unix
----

Edit port/cpl_config.h and modify to be appropriate to your platform.  The
most common change is to define WORDS_BIGENDIAN on big endian platforms like
Sun and SGI.  Other changes may be needed to get large file support working
or deal with other quirks. 

Run build.sh and it should build img2tif and hfatest executables. 


To use the Imagine library yourself just link against the object files
created from the port and hfa directories.
